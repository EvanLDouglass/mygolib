# mygolib
A collection of utilities for the Go programming language.

## Packages
'algs' is a parent directory for packages containing common algorithms.
It was created to help me learn algorithm textbook material by implementing the pseudo code in a concrete language.

'set' is a mini-project I decided to write after finishing an online, introductory course teaching Go.
It was inspired by an article on the official golang website that mentioned the posibility of implementing a simple set using a map.
It is very basic and probably should not be used, but was a fun exersize.
